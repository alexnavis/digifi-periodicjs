Coming Soon
### Configuration

Config variables can be passed in an object to the `periodic.init` method, or can be set any time before `periodic.start` is called using `periodic.set(key, value)`. This allows for a more flexible order of execution (e.g. if you refer to Lists in your routes, you can set the routes after configuring your Lists, as in the example above).

See the [PeriodicJS configuration documentation](http://periodicjs.com/docs/configuration) for details and examples of the available configuration options.


#### Testing
To run the test suite run `npm test`.
